Testing Elastic search

Originally I wanted to test elasticsearch by using interfaces offered by Grails.

Honestly: by far too complicated. Instead, I directly connected elasticsearch by
Javascript. To do this, I used AngularJS to build a single page.

How to start:
* get elastic search
* start it
* get this project
* grails run-app
* go to http://localhost:8080/elasticsearch/start/index

On this page you will find a cube that can be rotated by the elements in the top left corner.
You will find pages with images on it, one page to add articles, one to search and to click
and one page to read articles.

Have much fun!
